Hello, I'm Stuart.  I'm currently a postdoc working at
[DESY](https://www.desy.de), working on the European X-Ray
Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) in Hamburg, Germany.  Previously I was at
JAI@RHUL, where I worked on developing a Monte Carlo code for
radiation transport in particle accelerators, which I applied to the
Large Hadron Collider collimation system.


My interests:

- Physics
- Maths
- Python
- C++
- Cooking
- Finance/economics
- Rowing
- Cycling
- Podcasts: anything from the FT or the Economist
- The German language
